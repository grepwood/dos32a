System Requirements
===================
. IBM PC compatible computer
. 80386 processor

Where's the [Source Code]/[Binaries]/[Documentation]?
=====================================================
The following DOS/32A distributions are available:

2) dos32a-733-src.zip
3) dos32a-733-bin.zip

The first one contains the original "Liberty Edition" of the DOS Extender
version 7.1 released in 2002. It is the baseline for all the subsequent
releases and contains an installable version of DOS/32A.

The second is the source distribution of the most recent version of the
DOS Extender.

The last one is the binary distribution containing precompiled binaries
of the DOS Extender and its tools.

DEVELOPERS:
-----------
download all three distributions, install dos32a-710-installer.zip first,
then upgrade by unzipping dos32a-733-src.zip and dos32a-733-bin.zip into
DOS/32A installation folder overwriting existing files.

END-USERS:
----------
download the binary distribution, dos32a-733-bin.zip, unzip into a
folder of your choice and you are good to go (no installation required).

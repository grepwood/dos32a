1.0 - Synopsis
==============
DOS/32 Advanced DOS Extender is a drop-in replacement for the DOS/4GW
DOS Extender and compatibles. Being fast, small and flexible DOS/32A can
be used in many environments, from embedded systems to DOS emulators, by
both developers and end users alike.

=================
See updates.txt file (included with this distribution) for the list of
recent changes.

. IBM PC compatible hardware
. 80386 processor or better

4.0 - Distros Available
=======================
The following DOS/32A distributions are available:

1) dos32a-710-installer.zip
2) dos32a-735-src.zip
3) dos32a-735-bin.zip


1) contains the original "Liberty Edition" of DOS/32A version 7.1 . It is
the baseline for all the subsequent releases and includes an installable
version the DOS Extender.

2) is the source distribution of the most recent version of DOS/32A, it

DEVELOPERS:
-----------
Download all three distributions, install dos32a-710-installer.zip first,
then upgrade by unzipping dos32a-735-src.zip and dos32a-735-bin.zip into
DOS/32A installation folder overwriting existing files.

END-USERS:
----------
Download the binary distribution, dos32a-735-bin.zip, unzip into a folder
of your choice and you are good to go (no installation is required).

A rather comprehensive (but regrettably outdated) set of documentation
manuals is available on-line at http://dos32a.sourceforge.net . RTFM!



5.0 - Release Notes (and other useless trivia)
==============================================
I. DOS32A.EXE is uncompressed; do not compare its size to pmodew, wdosx, cw
et al which *are*. This is on purpose: if storage space is scarce (eg when
putting it into ROM or Flash memory) use your favorite exec compressor or
write a custom one. UPX works well shaving off circa 10K. Beware: you won't
be able to use SS.EXE config utility once DOS32A is compressed.

II. StarWars came out today: it was very loud, slightly out of focus and most
surprisingly entartaining. The "fear-hate-suffering" rhetoric is still there
but most of ridiculousness is now replaced with non-stop action rendered in
breathtaking CG. See this in theater (unless you're a student, unemployed or
just generally strapped for cash, in which case BitTorrent is your friend).

III. To address whining about DOS/32A not being able to cope with >256MB under
various ad hoc implementations of VCPI: a) learn to code, b) RTFM, it's all
in there.

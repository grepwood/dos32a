DOS/32 Advanced DOS Extender

Synopsis
==============
This is a DOS extender which is mostly a suitable drop-in replacement
for DOS4GW. It allows software to run in protected mode while in DOS.

System requirements
=========================
I don't know. DOS32A SDK claims the following is a minimum:
- IBM PC compatible computer
- 80386-SX 16MHz processor
- 4 MB RAM
- DOS version 4.00 or higher
- VGA compatible graphics card

It also lists the following "recommended" requirements, but judging by the
presence of OpenWatcom and Borland Turbo Assembler on the list, these are
probably the requirements to build DOS32A:
- IBM PC compatible computer
- Pentium class processor or better
- 16 MB of memory or more
- DOS version 7.x (Windows 95/98) or higher
- VESA VBE 2.0 compatible graphics card
- Mouse with Mouse driver installed
- WATCOM C/C++ version 10.6 or higher
- Borland Turbo Assembler version 4.0 or higher

What is Windows doing here is anyone's guess. We don't need no botnet to build
this thing.

Release notes
===================
We have commit logs for that.

FAQ
=========
Q: What's new?
A: Check the commit logs.

Q: I've found a bug, yippie! Now what?
A: File an issue on this Github page. If you find this README.md on another
git hosting site and it hides issues behind organization privacy settings,
screw them. Don't use their fork. This kind of behind-closed-doors-only-cool-
-kids-and-illuminati-allowed attitude towards bug reporting is annoying,
reprehensible and silly.
